# Setting up a blog on Github pages

Today, I'll walk you through how to setup a blog on github pages using Jekyll Chirpy theme - just like this one.

First, let me outline all the tools and softwares we will use.

1. Ruby+Devkit - https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
2. Git - https://git-scm.com/download/win
3. VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download


Jekyll is a Ruby Gem and so we need to prepare the environment by installing Ruby. This can be found at  and choose Ruby+Devkit 3.2.2-1(x64) (latest version at time of this writing)

Use the default settings while installing and make sure the option to "Run 'ridk install" is checked. Click on Finish

Upon clicking finish, you will be prompted to choose what components to install. Here, if it is the first time installing Ruby, just click Enter and wait until it completes.

After it completes, run the following command to install all the dependencies
```cmd
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Now, the we are ready to go all in!
