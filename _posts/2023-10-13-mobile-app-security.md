We are in the digital era where the usage of mobile devices has skyrocketted. This has caused mobile applications to be an integral part of our lives as they help us perform our daily  tasks efficiently while staying connected.  

According to a [survey by DataSparkle](https://www.datasparkle.net/home/pc/en/researchReport/index.html) that was published on [Africa Business Communities](https://africabusinesscommunities.com/africadata/africa-had-more-than-270-million-mobile-apps-users-as-of-december-2022-report/), 'the total number of monthly active users of mobile apps in Africa exceeded 270 million, a 14% increase compared to the beginning of the year by December 2022' where 'The number of active users of finance apps in Africa exceeded 73 million, an increase of 26%.  
The number of active users of shopping apps surpassed 36 million, up 6% in the same given period'

# What is Mobile Application Security?
Mobile Application Security is a process that employs technologies and well defined security procedures to safeguard mobile applications from cyber threats and data theft. Ideally, it encompassess identifying, fixing and enhancing the security of mobile applications. In this context, we will focus on the two competing giants - Android OS and IOS.  
The Mobile Application Security Methodology by OWASP provides a standard approach in achieving this goal

# Why is Mobile Application Security Important?
With the uprise uptake, and integration of the core operations such as banking, shopping among others into mobile applications, vast amount of sensistive and personal data is being processed by the apps. If not properly secured, this data may end up in the wrong hands hence compromising the CIA triad.  
The following are some of the specific reasons why mobile application security is important and why it should be enforced.  
1. __To protect user data__ - information such as financial information, personal identifiable information and health info is a gold mine and should be protected at all costs.
2. __To comply with regulations__ - With the implementation of Data Protection Act 2019, compliance is at the fore-front of every organization
3. __To maintain business continuity__ - Business operations are greatly affected incase of a successful attack. To avoid this, Mobile application security should be enhanced.
4. __To improve customer trust__ - Gaining customers' loyalty and trust goes beyond offering them services. In this context, security is a major contributing factor to customer satisfaction and retention.

# Recent Mobile Application Threat Trends 
Bearing the fact that our mobile phones are just an arm-length away means that interactions with various mobile applications happen within a very short period but the amount of data transaction is massive. Attackers however don't slumber while curating new tactics. Some of the top threat trends seen in the recent past include
1. Phishing attacks  - this remains to be one of the persistent threats across the years. Attackers having been using Emails, text messages and even voice to achieve this goal. Mobile device users are very susceptible to these attacks since the email apps display less information on the screen to accomodate the screen size

2. Data leaks - This happen due to unregulated permissions granted to mobile applications when installing them. They collect 
3. Open(unsecured) WIFI
4. Spyware
5. Apps with Malicious code


# What are the risk factors and what is the price?
Often, we as the users facilitate some of the attacks knowingly or unknowingly. Some of the underlying risk factors that are related to mobile appliation security include
1. Mobile apps vulnerabilities
2. Third Party libraries
3. Authentication and authorization
4. Data encryption
5. User behaviour

# Mobile application security measures to employ
Protecting mobile applications is a shared responsibility between the users and developers. Users have the great responsibility since they interact with the applications more. Some of the protective measures include  
* Using the official app store
* Read and regularly review the App permissions
* Update apps regularly
* Employ strong authentication measures
* Use Security apps
* Back up data
* Use VPNs when connecting to public networks
* Report Suspicios activity
* Stay informed

# Mobile Application Testing
Employing protective measures on the user side is not just enough. A mobile application assessment is crucial and essential in enhancing the security of the application. The process of mobile application testing involves  
* Testing vulnerabilities through simulated attacks to assess the security strengths and weaknesses of your app.
* Analyzing internal controls and examine the code to investigate potential malware and danger.
* Monitoring the application interface and infrastructure to locate any security flaws.
* Improving security posture and crafting an actionable security plan with expert guidance.
